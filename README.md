# 🚀 SIA Intelligence  
### Voice‑First AI Financial Coach for Small Businesses  
*Built at MumbaiHacks 2025 | Made in India, for the businesses that build India*

## 🧠 Theme Alignment  
**Theme: AI for Real‑World Impact | Fintech + Agentic Intelligence**

SIA Intelligence is built on one core belief:  
> *Small business owners don’t just need software — they need a second financial brain.*

This project aligns with the hackathon theme by combining:
- Agentic AI for real‑time decision making  
- Fintech intelligence for cashflow, credit & risk  
- Voice interface for real‑world usability  
- Preventive guidance instead of passive dashboards

## ❗ The Problem  

Millions of informal and small businesses operate with:
- Unpredictable daily income  
- Untracked expenses  
- Emotional credit (udhaar) decisions  
- Sudden cash shortages  
- Frequent stock‑outs  

Existing apps only **record data**.  
They **do not understand behavior**, **do not forecast risks**, and **do not guide daily decisions**.  
As a result, even profitable shops face stress, losses, and instability.

## ✅ The Solution — SIA Intelligence  

**SIA is a voice‑first, agentic AI fintech assistant** that:
- Listens to real business activity through natural speech  
- Learns sales, expenses, credit & stock behavior  
- Understands daily financial health  
- Predicts upcoming risks  
- Guides the owner with clear daily actions  

Users don’t operate software — **they simply talk to SIA**.
